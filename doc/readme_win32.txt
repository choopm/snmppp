In regards to the Win32 .exe installer for SNMPpp:

I am not typically a Windows developer.  At my day job, I develop mostly for Linux.

Thus, this Windows "port" is very likely broken.  I've solved all of the compiler issues when I compile using Visual Studio Ultimate 2013, and managed to get everything to link, but I have no idea if it was done correctly.

I would greatly appreciate any patches, notes, contributions, ... from any Windows developer who makes use of SNMPpp.
