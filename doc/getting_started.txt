==SUMMARY==

This project contains some C++ helper classes for SNMP.  These classes and helper functions were written specifically to help interface to the open source project net-snmp (https://sourceforge.net/projects/net-snmp/).

==GETTING STARTED (BINARIES) ==

If all you need to do is link against SNMPpp, download and install the SNMPpp dev .deb package.

For example, you can find the latest version at http://sourceforge.net/projects/snmppp/files/

Then to install the .deb from the command-line, you'd use a command such as this one:

    sudo dpkg -i snmppp-dev-0.0.3-14-Linux.deb

If some dependencies are missing, running this might resolve the problem:

    sudo apt-get install -f

Once the package is correctly installed, the relevant files are:

    /usr/include/SNMPpp/*
    /usr/lib/libsnmppp.*

At a minimum, your .cpp source files need to have this:

    #include <SNMPpp/SNMPpp.hpp>

And at link time, you need to use either libsnmppp.a (static) or libsnmppp.so (dynamic).

You're done.  You can skip the rest of this file.

==GETTING STARTED (FROM SOURCE) ==

Quick guide on getting started with SNMPpp:

    - download dependencies (e.g., "sudo apt-get install cmake libsnmp-dev ..."; see "installing_snmp_ubuntu.txt")
    - download SNMPpp (e.g., "git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/snmppp snmppp")
    - cd snmppp/
    - mkdir build
    - cd build
    - cmake ..
    - make

Other possible targets include:  "make test", "sudo make install", "make package" or "make package_source".

==DIRECTORIES==

The code you'll want to build and/or link against is in the following two directories:

    - code/src/*.cpp
    - code/include/SNMPpp/*.hpp

Other directories to point out is a series of examples and test cases which can be easily referenced to get started:

    - code/examples/*.cpp
    - code/test/*.cpp

==NET-SNMP==

Personally, I found working with net-snmp strangely difficult as I tend to get lost in the various APIs, or confused by the unfamiliar (to me!) SNMP terminology.  This is probably 100% my own fault due to me not having found the right net-snmp "getting started" documentation.  Please keep this in mind as it means some of the SNMPpp code may be doing the wrong thing for you, or may not be doing it in an efficient manner.  Let me know if you run into issues, or if you have patches to contribute!

One of the most important things to highlight is the difference between the old "Traditional API" for net-snmp API, and the newer "Single API".

The "Traditional API" is not thread-friendly, while the newer "Single API" can be used in both single-threaded and multi-threaded applications.  For this reason, SNMPpp uses the "Single API".  More details on this can be found here:  http://www.net-snmp.org/docs/README.thread.html

The "Single API" typically has functions that start with "snmp_sess_".  For example:

    TRADITIONAL         SINGLE API
    -----------         ----------
    snmp_sess_init()    snmp_sess_init()
    snmp_open()         snmp_sess_open()
    snmp_send()         snmp_sess_send()
    snmp_read()         snmp_sess_read()
    snmp_error()        snmp_sess_error()
