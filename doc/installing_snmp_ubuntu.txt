The SNMP++ project is not about installing or running SNMP, but as a basic requirement to using it or developing with SNMP++, you must have access to a valid SNMP server.  Normally, the easiest way to do this is to get SNMP running on the same development platform or VM as where SNMP++ will be used.

These are my own SNMP setup notes (February 2013); use them as-is, or as a starting reference:

- install Ubuntu 12.10 64-bit in a VM
- sudo apt-get install snmp libsnmp-dev snmpd snmp-mibs-downloader
- edit /etc/snmp/snmp.conf and comment out the empty "mibs :" line
- run this command to test it:    snmpwalk -c public -v 2c 127.0.0.1 .1

The default snmpd configuration file forces snmpd to listen on 127.0.0.1.  To open it up to all interfaces:

- edit /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
- look for this line:  agentAddress udp:127.0.0.1:161
- change it like this: agentAddress udp:161,tcp:161
- restart the server:  sudo service snmpd restart
- run this command to test it:    snmpwalk -c public -v 2c 192.168.x.x .1
(Obviously use the correct IP address.)

The default snmpd configuration file only provides a very small subset of the SNMP MIB tree.  This is controlled using views, where different users from different source addresses can be shown a different amount of information.  To enable the full MIB tree from SNMP requests on 127.0.0.1:

- edit /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
- look for this line:    #rocommunity public localhost
- uncomment it:          rocommunity public localhost
- restart the server:  sudo service snmpd restart
- run this command to test it:    snmpwalk -c public -v 2c 127.0.0.1 .1
- you should now see several thousand lines of output
- to see the numeric OIDs:        snmpwalk -c public -v 2c -On 127.0.0.1 .1
- to see the short name:          snmpwalk -c public -v 2c -OS 127.0.0.1 .1
- to see the full name:           snmpwalk -c public -v 2c -Ou 127.0.0.1 .1

Obviously there is much more that can be configured with snmpd.conf, some of which has important security implications.  I strongly suggest you read through the man page for snmpd.conf to ensure snmpd isn't left wide open with a common default community string.
